document.write("<FONT COLOR= YELLOW>The hypothesis of this experiment was that Milk of Magnesia would be the best antacid to neutralize pH. The hypothesis was correct. After the experimenter tested all the antacids and did the average of all the three trials, the highest pH reading was the Milk of Magnesia and its ph level number was at 9.27. This means that the Milk of Magnesia neutralizes the grapes and lemon juice mixture to become a base. The experimenter also observed that when you mix the different antacids, Milk of Magnesia, Gaviscon, and Pepto- Bismol, they form different chemical reactions. For instance, when the experimenter mixed the Gaviscon antacid, the texture of the substance or liquid became thick and foamy. Before the Gaviscon was mixed, it had a thin texture. The texture changes because of the materials and chemicals that the antacid is made from. This was a fair test because it had three trials which means it would be accurate and the experimenter followed all the control variables properly. Also, it is a fair test because the independent variable has been allowed to affect the dependent variable. In the future to make this project better, effective, and convenient, the experimenter would conduct this experiment at different temperatures, figure out how much quantity of antacid is needed to bring the ph level to neutral(7), and monitor the duration until when the effect of antacid remains. Also, most importantly, the experimenter would check after how long the ph level starts to drop, and this would be very helpful. This would be good because if scientists and doctors were to study more and get more knowledge about when the influence of the antacid began to decline, they would be able to create antacids that last longer and reduce the acidity of the stomach. If people are suffering from severe acidity in the stomach, these antacids would relieve pain and neutralize the acidity quicker. </FONT>");
