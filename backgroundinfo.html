<h1 align=center>Background Information</h1>
Antacids neutralize stomach acid to cut down on heartburn, sour stomach, acid indigestion, and stomach upset. They contain ingredients such as aluminum, calcium, magnesium, or sodium bicarbonate which are bases to counteract stomach acid and make its pH or acidity more neutral. pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution and this determines how acidic that solution is. The scale ranges from 1 to 14, where below 7 is acidic, 7 is neutral, and above 7 bases. Antacids can be used to treat symptoms of excess stomach acid, such as:
<br>
- acid reflux, which can include regurgitation, bitter taste, persistent dry cough, pain when lying down, and trouble swallowing
<br>
- heartburn, which is a  burning sensation in your chest or throat caused by acid reflux
<br>
- indigestion, which is a pain in your upper gut that can feel like gas or bloating
<br>
Antacid comes in many different forms. For instance, liquid, chewable gummy or tablet, or tablet that you dissolve in water to drink. Some popular brands of antacid are Pepto-Bismol, Mylanta, Tums, and Milk of Magnesia. One of the best and quickest healers of stomach acidity, constipation, digestion, and heartburn is  Milk of Magnesia. This is because Milk of magnesia contains magnesium, which is a naturally occurring mineral. The human body requires magnesium to help many of its systems function properly, most notably the muscles and nerves. People use milk of magnesia as a laxative to relieve constipation and to ease indigestion and heartburn. This is because it can reduce the amount of stomach acid while increasing water in the intestines.                                          Antacids can change the way your body absorbs the other medicines you are taking. There are also many side effects that are caused by antacid:
<br>
- Brands with magnesium may cause diarrhea.
<br>
- Brands with calcium or aluminum may cause constipation.
<br>
- Rarely, brands with calcium may cause kidney stones or other problems.
